ChemTensor
==========

Tensor network algorithms for chemical systems.

This library is written in C, offering a Python 3 interface for more straightforward accessibility.

Documentation is available at [chemtensor.readthedocs.io](https://chemtensor.readthedocs.io).


Examples
--------
The [examples](examples/) folder contains several demonstrations of the functionalities. Most examples use Jupyter notebooks and the Python interface.


Features
--------
- Matrix product state and operator structures
- Represent common Hamiltonians as MPOs, including molecular Hamiltonians
- General MPO construction with optimized bond dimensions from a list of operator chains
- Block-sparse tensors based on additive quantum number conservation to implement abelian symmetries
- Single- and two-site DMRG algorithm
- Gradient computation with respect to MPO parameters
- Tensor hypercontraction form of molecular Hamiltonians
- Tree tensor network topologies (work in progress)
- Non-abelian symmetries (work in progress)


Installation
------------
ChemTensor can be conveniently installed as a Python package (in a virtual environment) via
```bash
(venv) $ pip install chemtensor
```
This downloads and installs a pre-built Python "wheel" from PyPI; see [pypi.org/project/chemtensor/](https://pypi.org/project/chemtensor/).

Alternatively, you can build the project locally; see the instructions below.

Note that ChemTensor can also run as standalone C code.


Building
--------
The code requires the BLAS, LAPACK, HDF5, and Python 3 development libraries with NumPy. These can be installed via 
- `sudo apt install libblas-dev liblapacke-dev libhdf5-dev python3-dev python3-numpy` (on Ubuntu Linux)
- `brew install hdf5 python3 numpy` (on arm64 macOS together with the Accelerate framework)

From the project directory, use `cmake` to build the project:
```bash
mkdir build_ct && cd build_ct
cmake ../
cmake --build .
```
Currently, this will compile the unit tests, which you can run via `./chemtensor_test`, as well as the demo examples and Python module library.

To build the corresponding Python package directly, ensure that the Python [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/) tool is installed, and run
```bash
python3 -m build . --wheel
pip3 install dist/chemtensor-...whl
```
The first line should run `cmake` in the background and create a Python "wheel" (.whl file) in the `dist/` subfolder. This package file can then be installed locally via the second line.


Coding style conventions
------------------------
- Generally, follow the current coding style of the project.
- Naming: lower_case_with_underscores in general (variable, function, and struct names); exceptionally CAPITALIZATION for preprocessor and enum constants.
- Tabs for indentation at the beginning of a line, otherwise whitespace. This ensures that vertical alignment (of, e.g., comments for struct members) is independent of tab size. Avoid trailing whitespace.
- Comments: // for normal comments, /// for Doxygen documentation.
- Put curly braces `{ }` after every `if` and `else` (to avoid pitfalls).
- Left-align pointers throughout: `int* p` instead of `int *p`.
- Keep the `struct` and `enum` keywords in variable types: `struct foo f;` instead of `typedef struct foo { ... } foo_t; foo_t f;`.
- Use `const` for function arguments which are not modified by the function.
