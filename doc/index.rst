`ChemTensor <https://github.com/qc-tum/chemtensor>`_ is an efficient tensor network library for electronic structure calculations of chemical systems (typically small molecules). It is based on the matrix product state (MPS) and tree tensor network state (TTNS) formalism and variants of DMRG.

`ChemTensor <https://github.com/qc-tum/chemtensor>`_ is written in C for performance reasons. The file `basic_dmrg_fermi_hubbard.c <https://github.com/qc-tum/chemtensor/blob/main/examples/dmrg/basic_dmrg_fermi_hubbard.c>`_ contains a standalone demonstration of constructing the Fermi-Hubbard model Hamiltonian as MPO and running DMRG.

`ChemTensor <https://github.com/qc-tum/chemtensor>`_ also offers a Python 3 interface for more straightforward accessibility and experimentation.
